Loom! (v2)
==========

What if Twine stories could be multiplayer?

Loom is a very simple platform that serves mutant multiplayer twines.
We inject some extra code into the story, and the server keeps track of user presense as you navigate the story tree.

This is a re-write of [this project]("https://github.com/pgulley/loom") using node.js as the backend instead of python


### What's it for??
Covid-inspired telepresence weirdness


### Status 
As of right now, the core logic responsible for tracking clients within twines is rewritten and functional.
I'm in the process of a several day sprint to get user profiles and admin panels up and running.

I'm going to be implimenting new user presense using [this repository](https://github.com/pgulley/svg_wiggles) once all the behind-the-scenes stuff is happy.
